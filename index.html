            <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
            <p>Our minor seminary is dedicated to nurturing the spiritual, intellectual, and personal growth of young men discerning a vocation to the priesthood. Rooted in the rich traditions of the Catholic faith and guided by the teachings of Jesus Christ, our mission is to form servant leaders who embody the virtues of humility, compassion, and integrity. At our minor seminary, we strive to create a supportive and nurturing environment where students can deepen their relationship with God, explore their calling, and discern their unique gifts and talents. We are committed to providing a comprehensive and holistic formation that encompasses spiritual, academic, and pastoral dimensions. Spiritually, we seek to cultivate a vibrant prayer life, fostering a deep love for God and a fervent devotion to the sacraments. <br>Through daily prayer, reflection, and spiritual direction, students are encouraged to grow in intimacy with Christ and to discern God’s will for their lives. Intellectually, we are dedicated to providing a rigorous academic curriculum that challenges students to think critically, engage with theological and philosophical truths, and develop a well-rounded understanding of the Catholic faith. Our faculty, comprised of dedicated priests and educators, are committed to excellence in teaching and mentorship, guiding students in their intellectual pursuits and fostering a lifelong love of learning.  Personally, we aim to foster the holistic development of each student, nurturing their physical, emotional, and social well-being. Through a variety of extracurricular activities, retreats, and community service opportunities, students are encouraged to develop their gifts and talents, cultivate virtues such as empathy and resilience, and become compassionate leaders who are dedicated to serving others.</p>
